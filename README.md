# Fare_Analysis
Challenge assignment for Module 5

VIsualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to conduct an analysis of fares and break them down by the type of community they are run in. For this project, Omar and I will have to write some matplotlib codes to organzize the fare data by city type and analyze how they run over the course of January to December.
